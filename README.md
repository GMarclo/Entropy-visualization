# Entropy-visualization

This is my C++ project built with SFML that simulates and visualizes the process of entropy increase in a particle system.
Each particle has an associated temperature, which is represented by a color. When particles interact, their temperatures tend to equalize, providing a visual model of energy distribution and entropy growth.

Features:
 - Color-coded particles – temperature mapped to visible colors.
 - Entropy simulation – demonstrates how local temperature differences lead to equilibrium.
 - Interactive editor mode – select regions with the mouse and assign custom temperatures.
 - Even temperature assignment
 - Random temperature assignment within a given range
 - Real-time visualization with SFML.
